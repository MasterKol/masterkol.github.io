		<p>This simulation is meant to roughly mirror the AI learning algorithim known as <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">NEAT</a>. This is only a rough copy because of the lack of speciation in my implementation, however the agents are able to solve this task well and optimize their route quickly.<br><br>The Agents in this implementation have two detectors facing 45 degrees from forwards that tell them the distance to the wall in that direction (as a percent of the maximum detectable distance).</p>
