		<p style="color: white; width: 700px;">This is a simulation of a double pendulum system, the differential equations that describe this system were solved using the lagrangian method. In order to expand this to longer pendulums I constructed general equations for the system and solved them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ueXFrod1N4tD9R_az8eydxTfb1a0G9q9Kx3WvmVwV6o/edit?usp=sharing" style="color: lightblue;">here</a>. These equations get solved in python so I currently have no way to upload it to a website, these equations work for the most part however they are unstable and the energy in the system tends towards infinity for longer pendulums. <br> This system is composed of 10 double pendulums offset from eachother by &plusmn;10<sup>-6</sup> radians and quickly diverge because of the chaotic nature of the system.<br><a href="https://github.com/MasterKol/masterkol.github.io/tree/master/Pendulum">Code</a></p>
