		<p>In cities, traffic is vastly increasing travel time from place to place and greatly decreasing connectivity between people in it. Cities are not doing enough to optimize small stops, which can lead to large delays in travel time and huge backups in traffic. In the city of Atlanta there are many of these such stops which slow commutes and disincentivize people from traveling around the city.</p>

		<h2 class="SubHeader">Solutions<h2>
		<p>1. According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243514/" class="link" target="_blank">a study done by Kai Zhanga and Stuart Batterman</a> "Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality". By increasing the rate of flow of traffic not only would such congestion be cleaned up, but the total time cars spend on the road would also be significantly reduced.</p>
		<p>2. Computer learning algorithms can be taught to optimize traffic flow in order to take the load of managing hundreds of traffic stops off of the shoulders of humans. If first taught in a simulation and then slowly implemented in real life, they can get very good at optimizing the flow of traffic.</p>
		<p>3. Systems like <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/" class="link" target="_blank">the loop</a> designed by The Boring Company can help to take automobile and foot traffic off of the road. This system would be managed by fully autonomous electric skis and allow people and cars to travel at speeds from to 200-250 km/hr</p>

	<!--  where slight changes such as the type of stop, or tweaking the delay between changing a light could make a substancial difference in the flow of traffic. One way to measure the flow of traffic is to find average speed of traffic passing a specfic point.  !-->
